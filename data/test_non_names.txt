Stigmatized as moral cowards
Red tape of officialdom
At this juncture
I have shown
I must consider this as
I am so sorry--so very sorry
He lay as straight as a mummy
Openly flouted and disavowed
Indeed! How?
There yet remains
But I pass that over
An utter depression of soul
Her hair was like a coronet
We must judge it leniently
Not at all
A new doubt assailed her
Since, then, it is provided
I could never understand
But it is not my intention
L
As memory scans the past
I see no exception
It is not by any means
I am bold to say
The tranquil aspects of society
I shall often have to advert to
But with these exceptions
Latent vein of whimsical humor
A
fuse into unity
It is the universal testimony
iconoclastic attitude icy smile
I will not try to gauge
I can not prevail on myself
We may all of us agree
The world is bitter as a tear
I really do not know
His face was glad as dawn to me
The theory seems at first sight
D
Upon receiving your letter of
It is a most pertinent question
No man regrets more than I do
Fettered by poverty and toil
As you probably have been told
I am old enough to remember
Now, it is not at all strange
I desire to know
My duty is to endeavor to show
Broadly speaking
It is just so far true
There is a multitude of facts
Will it be whispered
It is easy enough to add
E
The song of hurrying rivers
I do not myself pretend to be
Like a dream she vanished
So I inferred
Defiant of analysis and rule
The inference is inescapable
It is for others to illustrate
scenes and associations

I am in favor of

As some one has well said
The glow of the ambitious fire

sophistical argument
Wiser counsels prevailed
I tremble at the task
The afternoon was waning
If we may trust to experience
A tissue of dull excuses
I can sympathize with you
Links in the chain of reasoning
Generosity pushed to prudence
I beg and implore of you
The time is now come for me
The chill of forlorn old age
A sort of stunned incredulity
I note with particular pleasure
graphic and gorgeous
I desire to lay emphatic stress
puffy and dissipated
I do not fear a contradiction
If anyone is so dim of vision
One other circumstance
I declare to you
J
Let everyone consider
Rude and blind criticism
I simply pause here to ask
I think it is superb!
His mood yielded
But surely, you can not say
It is true
What do we gain by
I have in a measure anticipated
The lofty grace of a prince
This is like saying
A nimble-witted opponent
Do not imagine
As stupid as a sheep
A flourish of rhetoric
Take root in the heart
But this we may put aside
I presume I shall have to admit
faded, dusty, and unread
I can not charge myself with
I abide by my statement
Indeed, you are wholly wrong
Still as death
One important topic remains
In the existing circumstances
But my answer to this objection
It would be a proud distinction
openly disseminated
It is at once inconsistent
Nor can I forget either
isolated and detached
I am not proposing to set forth
Like a golden-shielded army
If I have in any way deserved
A prop for my faint heart
True, I forgot! U
We are not able to prove
Such is the truth
I only wish you to recognize
I surmised as much
The winnowed tastes of the ages
In looking about me
It seems almost incredible
I have the honor to propose
Deep shame and rankling remorse
It does not necessarily follow
It is for you to decide
tyrant and oppressor
I am not inquisitive
The excitement of rival issues
Fluid as thought
I hope none who hear me
furious with indignation
I am lost in admiration
A
Stripped to its bare skeleton
Colored like a fairy tale
If I am wrong
If we are to reason on the fact
I am conscious of the fact
F
I am not ripe to pass sentence
Let me add my final word
I do not want to discourage you
Roared like mountain torrents
I do not choose to consume
Recently we had occasion
You know very well
I have depicted
No one can, I think, pretend
I think it quite admirable
H
How do you account for
You will have ample opportunity
As merry as bees in clover
Seize on greedily
Such, sir, I conceive to be
I ask your attention
The belief is born of the wish
I rest my opinion on
I will only sum up my evidence
He shambled away with speed
Thus analogy suggests
ceremonious courtesy
One long torture of soul
It is often very misleading
For behold
If we isolate ourselves
O
Let us endeavor to understand
D
Pursuant to your letter
And here I reproach
Let us enumerate
I might venture to claim
I do not seek to palliate
I can not persuade myself
condemnable rashness
It is rather startling
I fancy it's just that
F
I gave notice just now
I think it will be granted
I am not a stranger to
I noticed incidentally the fact
But mark this
It is perfectly apparent
Now, we will inquire
At your earliest opportunity
A solemn utterance of destiny
prophetic vision
It is a living truth
I am here the advocate of
Let us take a concrete instance
As weird as the elfin lights
A ripple of applause
I recollect it clearly
We are not disinterested
I am unable to understand
Bent like a wand of willow
I must lament
I shall not tax your patience
It is well known
exertion and excitement
SECTION I
Seriously, then, do I beg you
A partial disenchantment
His swift and caustic satire
To these general considerations
I do not hesitate to say
And so I am reminded of a story
Glorious to contemplate
I do not ask you to
I would have you understand
We can presume
I am vastly obliged to you
I see no reason for doubting
vital interpretation
I was not without some anxiety
I might enter into such detail
I am led to believe
An assumption of hostile intent
In a wider sense
I was lost in admiration
I, for one, greatly doubt
I must not overlook
It is all very fine to think
T
Let us labor and pray
Will anyone answer
Your heart is as dry as a reed
I pay tribute to
It would interest me very much
It is now high time for me
fabric of fact
Banish such thoughts
P
U
Furious as eagles
I think you will all agree
I do not mistrust
I said a little way back
U
Instances abound
spurious and misleading
I might well think
We easily persuade ourselves
W
In contemplating the causes
A
I am naturally overjoyed
Soft as a zephyr
terror, remorse, and shame
I summon you to do your share
If I may take for granted
crystallized into action
A touch of exquisite pathos
The effect too often is
I must crave your indulgence
I am apprehensive
The air darkened swiftly
The Spring breaks like a bird
I have abstained from
Again, let us compare
I have been heretofore treating
A great many people have said
It would be idle for me
rust of neglect
With regard to your inquiry
Pardon me if
I desire to call attention
A tedious and needless drudgery
As supple as a step-ladder
As an impartial bystander
Untameable as flies
Here is your opportunity
It seems then that on the whole
This you can not deny
My skin is as sallow as gold
It is made evident
Mingled distrust and fear
It's all nonsense
An atmosphere of sunny gaiety
One of the ancients said
I think we can hardly hope
I rise in behalf
I must here admit
If in the years of the future
I will now consider with you
In quite incredible confusion
For mark you
N
It seems very ridiculous
And so in the present case
N
My soul was as a lampless sea
A phantom of the brain
The view is more misleading
It was not unkindly meant
That is really good of you
If anyone could conceive
available data avaricious eyes
Whatever the truth may be
frankness of manner
exterior, formal, and imposing
I shall not acknowledge
Lovely beyond all words
The gift of prophecy
It is interesting to know
I say it is extremely important
In my estimation
As austere as a Roman matron
Then again, in corroboration
This brings us to a subject
So at least it seems to me
I must ask an abrupt question
I have a great admiration for
But we ask, perhaps
I say it most confidently
Easy as a poet's dream
A swift knowledge came to her
exuberant and infectious
To make my story quite complete
I feel sure
I
Well, now, let us propose
A slowly subsiding frenzy
Certainly, one can conceive
If it be so
Oppressed by some vague dread
I wish to confirm my letter
I feel a certain apprehension
It is not necessarily true
The perils that beset us here
Now, I admit
R
Be these things as they may
She spoke with sweet severity
Let me here say
It certainly follows, then
Set down with meticulous care
I have laid much stress upon
I am sensible, sir
A river of shame swept over him
It is manifestly absurd to say
I can strongly recommend
Childlike contour of the body
It is quite too absurd
Obviously the matter is settled
I know that this is the feeling
N
O
It is an easy matter
A modicum of truth
Suddenly smitten with unreality
It follows inevitably
I hope the time may come again
It will not be expected from me
His mind was like a summer sky
dim and distant din and traffic
I remember full well
I pray God I may never
I will not pause to maintain
And I submit to you
untold calamity
Whence it is, I say
And it is not plain
She was exquisitely simple
That is most kind of you
It is a staggering thought
I dare venture the remark
I will take one more instance
One very striking tendency
I do not imagine
But I propose to speak to you
I have noticed of late years
I hear it sometimes said
If I am asked for the proof
It is indeed very clear
omniscient affirmation
The balm of solitary musing
puzzledom of life
Cold and hard as steel
An endless field for discussion
The paramount consideration is
I find no fault with
A vigilant reserve
I will tell you what puzzles me
We have come together to-night
Quibbling, I call it
I will endeavor in a brief way
In days to come
I suppose there is no one here
But lo! all of a sudden
It is related
Calculated to create disgust
For one I deny
I will enlarge no further
juvenile and budding
How may we serve you further?
How delightful to meet you
I am speaking plainly
It will be to your advantage
Vague as a dream
The testimony of history is
But I submit the whole subject
I would urge upon you
logical and consistent
I return, in conclusion, to
And it is undeniable, I say
And now observe how
A kind of fantastic patchwork
It is very doubtful whether
And I am bound to say
I am told on authority
It is an odd jealousy
Her face was dull as lead
An almost excessive exactness
I
I use very plain language
Products of dreaming indolence
cautious, prudent, and decisive
If it is contended
But you do not know for certain
We often hear persons say
I fear I cannot help you
Pardon me, but I don't think so
robust and rugged
A sane philosophy of life
I think it has its charm
P
This is conceded by
Now, what I want you to realize
I am compelled to, unluckily
grim and sullen
I hear you say to yourselves
S
Full-throated as the sea
An answer to this is now ready
D
As cattle driven by a gadfly
And it is not difficult to see
But the final value
Don't delude yourself
A lukewarm and selfish love
He used an unguarded adjective
But I wander from my point
A storm of public indignation
Immediate and effectual steps
It is therefore necessary
I make no reflection whatever
I must be contented with
I prefer to reserve my judgment
But this much I affirm as true
It has amused me hugely
I will speak plainly
I will venture to add
I admit the extreme complexity
I do not wonder
Her scarlet lip curled cruelly
You will understand my anxiety
Quite so
It is indeed true
A fugitive intangible charm
And eyes as bright as the day
And in like manner
It is fatal to suppose
It is on these grounds
I have thus stated the reason
If I may reverently say so
An awe crept over me
The radiant serenity of the sky
And it is one of the evidences
It's mere pride of opinion
D
You astonish me greatly
As innocent as a new laid egg
A crop of disappointments
Mute as an iceberg
W
If we pursue a different course
Not to my knowledge
First of all I ask
I do not absolutely assert
An incredible mental agility
You have done me great honor
Do not hesitate to let us know
It stung like a frozen lash
V
We frankly apologize to you
I have attempted thus hastily
I have labored to maintain
White like flame
Purge the soul of nonsense
The sum and fruit of experience
Yet I am willing to conclude
I want to think with you
Like sweet thoughts in a dream
I indulge the modest hope
I need not dwell
Look at it in another way
This is the great fact
I respect you for that
Alien to the purpose
This absurdity arises
Like a damp-handed auctioneer
I mean something more than that
A hopeless enigma
L
Love brilliant as the morning
ghastly loneliness
O
F
I have not said anything yet
The royal arrogance of youth
I am determined
A random gleam of light
It is a touching reflection
Q
I see little hope of
R
Naturally prone to believe
At the outset of this inquiry
A mere conjectural estimate
Thus far, I willingly admit
It is the doctrine of
P
I refuse to believe
I lay it down as a principle
earth, air, stars, and sea
I respectfully submit
Yet I am convinced
And I speak with reverence
The inference is obvious
You must have misunderstood me
I am myself greatly indebted
One remark I will make
I have all along implied
Look at the situation
I am sure you all hope
As society is now constituted
An inscrutable mystery
sin, selfishness, and luxury
She nestles like a dove
We can remember with pride
I foresaw the consequence
A short time since
Fragile as a spider's web
A swift unformulated fear
C
I will now leave this question
We shall feel compelled
It is an error of taste
My heart tells me
In the fullness of time
I do not know why
Undeniably true
It is also probably true
F
Withal decidedly handsome
W
Like a vaporous amethyst
It is for us to ask
Cold gaze of curiosity
I appreciate the significance
In a frenzy of fussy excitement
If the bare facts were studied
I look in vain
I will even go further and say
I am by no means certain
Diffusing beneficent results
In a gale of teasing merriment
Awaiting your pleasure
It is nevertheless true
That is not fair--to me
tremble with fear
Her face was like a light
A mind very like a bookcase
I don't underrate his kindness
I have in my possession
It must doubtless be admitted
What I suggest is
thrill of delight
C
We have sought on this occasion
Allow me to congratulate you
Thou must wither like a rose
I will endeavor to show you
Let us not be fearful
The flower of courtesy
I rely on your good sense
learned by rote
The intrusive question faded
I now pass to the question of
But this I fearlessly affirm
But however that may be
And here again, when I speak
The grim reality of defeat
Curtains of opaque rain
Railed at the world
A weird world of morbid horrors
We always endeavor to please
R
In an eminent degree
As far as my limits allow
I cannot precisely determine
It is not a practical question
Will you bear with me
Though thou be black as night
Be assured, then
It is very ingenious
We take it for granted
One gracious fact emerges here
He turned white as chalk
So far so good
We stand astonished at
I am quite discomfited
V
And here I wish you to observe
H
I verily believe
So it comes to pass
I was speaking generally
We desire to impress upon you
Q
We have no other alternative
grandeur and massiveness
I anticipate your argument
won by aggression worn by time
F
And so, again, as regard
I don't pretend to explain
A duel of brains
Oh, certainly, if you wish it
L
I feel it a proud privilege
Preposition "to" A
My age is as a lusty Winter
priority and predominance
Like dining with a ghost
This is a general statement
adaptive wit
U
Ominous and swift days
Peace brooded over all
I think we are justified
Does not the event show
Y
I might deny that
Dull and trite commonplaces
I know from experience how
I bemoaned my unlucky fate
damaging admission
D
Does it seem incredible? E
Bowed like a mountain
I predict that you will
I can not avoid confessing
Hardly less marvelous
We owe you a debt of gratitude
I would rather a thousand times
utilize to advantage
It is the fashion to extol
G
I am entirely at your disposal
A vast multitude of facts
It is almost proverbial
His agitation increased
B
The question is deeply involved
So far in general
Cheeks as soft as July peaches
U
I think we may well be proud of
All unconscious as a flower
Dance like a wave of the sea
Let us, then, be assured
The pageantry of sea and sky
I would venture to point out
It was, therefore, inevitable
It seems strange to be told
I myself have boundless faith
I have no excuse for intruding
Her head throbbed dangerously
The church swarmed like a hive
I think we may safely conclude
And I rejoice to know
I mention it to you to justify
It is substantially true
R
An obscure thrill of alarm
It is the clear duty of
Like a blast from a horn
A law of retributive justice
I must take occasion to say
I am not presumptuous to assert
I am not about to defend
utmost scorn
This is the obvious answer
I must hazard the story
Let us not flatter ourselves
I conceive this to be
If I can carry you with me
I am a little at a loss to know
I ask the audience
fervor and simplicity
Pray don't apologize
Smooth as a pond
I confess I have had my doubts
barest commonplaces
I have undertaken to speak
I was very much thrilled
You leave no alternative
I know there are some who think
She was both weary and placated
I have enlarged on this subject
I look with encouragement
I mistrust these wild impulses
O
I ask again
It is eminently proper
I would urge and entreat you
The dull derision of the world
My muscles are as steel
I call to mind how
If you were asked to point out
glowing with delight
I speak of this to show
I shall not weary your patience
I must speak plainly
gibe, mock, taunt, and jeer
It is immaterial whether
A face as pale as wax
It is not logical to say
Are we content to believe
We can see to some extent
Noble and sublime patience
One is fairly tempted to wish
A curious vexation fretted her
It is a well known fact
To stay his tottering constancy
Moved to unaccustomed tears
I have all but finished
And I would, moreover submit
It may be useful to trace
There is another class of men
The enchanting days of youth
In one other respect
He threw round a measuring eye
Can you yield yourselves
Yet it is perfectly plain
It makes life insupportable
A temporary expedient
V
Wantonly and detestably unkind
I can not say how glad I am
Occasionally you ought to read
But do not let us depend
It grieves me to relate
I
I have endeavored to emphasize
A fund of curious information
As patient as the trees
On sure ground of fact
It is but too true
Thus if you look into
basis of fact
Wholly alien to his spirit
It is incredible!
We shall use every endeavor
But recollect, I pray you, how
breathless eagerness
You can hardly be serious
It is a theme too familiar
I have only partially examined
The sound of the sea waxed
I ask no greater blessing
It is but fair to say
Taken in their totality
I wish emphatically to reaffirm
cantankerous enemy
There is a class of person
Religious rights and ceremonies
It will be well and wise
B
Had my limits allowed it
ruthless commercialism
I hold this to be a truth
No one need to exaggerate
Indeed we know
I have partly anticipated
Let me illustrate again
O
As a special favor we ask
An eager and thirsty ear
Ran like a young fawn
The next point is
Is it, then, any wonder
How momentous, then
If I may be allowed to refer
It was a brilliant answer
I am suggesting the reason why
You excite my curiosity
Nor can we forget how long
Happily for us
B
There are, indeed, exceptions
And thus consistently
A piece of grotesque stupidity
Here then is the key
Do me the honor of believing
Now, with regard to
sturdy genuineness
You interest me deeply
I have good reason for
indecorously amused
But I will allude
Clear as crystal
An insatiable voracity
We hear it is said sometimes
The huge and thoughtful night
I know not how else to express
A ceaselessly fleeting sky
A glittering infectious smile
I have had the honor
You can not assert
I give my word gladly
F
Most dangerous!
But I repeat
It is a strange fact
A harassing anxiety of sorrow
In regard to your proposition
Rent by internal contentions
F
I am quite conscious that
B
I am luckily disengaged to-day
Crisp sparkle of the sea
That way madness lies
I must pause a moment to
In a vague and fragmentary way
vitalized by thought
You may depend upon it
I am very sure you will believe
Then again, when men say
As close as oak and ivy stand
W
Resist a common adversary
I will ask the indulgence
I
Day stood distinct in the sky
I fearlessly challenge
There is a degree of evidence
R
Memory was busy at his heart
It affords me gratification
I am not advocating
Oh, yes, I quite admit that
I know not of my own knowledge
W
J
It is pitiable to reflect
If you don't mind my saying so
I tremble to think
C
It is a huge undertaking
Like an enraged tiger
A crumb of consolation
H
But on the other hand
From the standpoint of
As elastic as a steel spring
Well, more's the pity
I didn't mean that--exactly
An intense travail of mind
ebb and flow
I use the word advisedly
I might well have desired
Across the gulf of years
We want to remind you again
No defense is to be found
S
obscure, difficult, and subtle
The dictates of plain reason
Airy swiftness of treatment
Yes, I dare say
We have no means of knowing
I come next to the question of
We again solicit an opportunity
C
It is rather startling
I wish you to observe
As dry as desert dust
It will be interesting to trace
A century of disillusionment
I am not vindictive
But that's a tremendous hazard
Biting sentences flew about
unshrinking determination
The allurements of a coquette
I would infinitely rather
narrowed by custom
It is a very significant fact
I find it more easy
literal and exact
royal exultations
S
It's very wonderful
O
I shall invite you to follow me
I say in moderation
We have the evidence of this
Render null and void
I am here to introduce
R
In order to realize adequately
V
I must now beg to ask
I object strongly to the use
A monstrous travesty
Z
Is it not obvious
The important thing is
We have to admit
It is simply a coincidence
I am not bold enough to
It is far from me to desire
It seems incredible
To the conclusion thus drawn
I can scarcely boast that honor
I don't doubt it for a moment
C
And in order to see this
L
Full and tuneful diction
The day is at hand
I am perfectly willing to admit
Endlessly shifting moods
A supposed ground of affinity
I, for my part, would rather
But everyone who deserves
I was constantly watchful to
A course of arrogant obstinacy
By temperament incompatible
Like dead lovers who died true
Again, it is quite clear that
I do not fail to admire
Time would not permit me
I pass on from that
The day was gracious
Bandied to and fro
You are most kind
I was very much interested
Then the question arises
I
I have been decidedly impressed
But we are to recollect
May I not speak here
I lately heard it affirmed
vow of allegiance
In all or any of these views
I detest exaggeration
I have no scruple in saying
Nor can it justly be said
I have the confident hope
I
Let us brush aside once for all
Hoping for a definite reply
I protest I never had any doubt
His gaze faltered and fell
I have no acquaintance with
B
Does it not shock you to think
Shames us out of our nonsense
I wish to draw your attention
Not only so
Little less than scandalous
We write to suggest to you
White as a ghost from darkness
It has seldom been surpassed
I have yet a more cogent reason
I do not, therefore, wonder
One can not decline to note
I am not blind to the faults of
I am glad to express the belief
