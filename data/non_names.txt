I own I can not help feeling
G
On a noble and commanding scale
A sense of meditative content
I do not recount all
I must remind my hearers of
inky blackness
By way of rejoinder
This is not all
How much better, I say, if
The insolence of power
fertile fancy
sharp rebuke
I thank you for the honor
If you seek the real meaning of
That theory isn't tenable
As by a secret of freemasonry
B
The still voice of the poet
An icy indifference
T
It is to be remembered
Nor can we now ask
It defies description
K
But this is what I mean
For this reason, indeed, it is
I fervently trust
I am not here to defend
Do I need to describe
Huge as a hippopotamus
P
I may take as an instance
pity, sympathy, and compassion
In listening to the kind words
A thousand mangled delusions
P
I am glad to notice
It is a matter of fact
V
This is the point of view
You have my deepest sympathy
U
Just mail the enclosed card
M
I am also satisfied
Hence it follows
Cruel as death
Here undoubtedly it is
What would you expect me to do?
But while it may be admitted
The hours crawled by like years
Veiled by some equivocation
I marvel that
I shall desist from
In the last suggestion
At the utmost we can say
repel with indignation
It is all very inexcusable
Lionized by fashionable society
I have taken pains to know
If we survey
It is a wholesome symptom
Serenity of paralysis and death
In a fever of apprehension
As gay and busy as a brook
Bright as a diamond in the sun
It is hardly for me
It is difficult to put a limit
Half-suffocated by his triumph
I hope I shall not be told
Here I am considering
And it happens
That is all very good
I see no possibility of
Trouble gathered on his brow
It is by no means my design
The gratification of ambition
In what case, for example?
Let me speak frankly
Is it logically consistent
organized in thought
O
It strikes me with wonder
G
I wish to do full justice to
I have pointed out
Consider, I beg you, what
Like oceans of liquid silver
All that is conjecture
Read but your history aright
I believe that in this instance
Can you lightly contemplate
As a general rule I hold
Soft as sleep the snow fell
It is with great pleasure
If I mistake not the sentiment
note of triumph
Curious as a lynx
An ardent and gifted youth
I am free to admit
epicurean taste
I am not undertaking to deliver
Snug as a bug in a rug
Speaking in this place
A dereliction of duty
Let us likewise remember
It is difficult to describe
My experience tells me
Once more I emphasize
I thoroughly agree with you
He went hot and cold
Chill breath of winter
The answer is ready
I do not need to remind you
Like a summer-dried fountain
The sentiment is worthy of you
E
His brow grew knit and gloomy
Enforced by coercive measures
A flippant rejoinder
Drift along the stream of fancy
I can by no calculation justify
It would indeed be unworthy
It would be unfair to praise
There are those who wish
mountainous inequalities
I wish it first observed
I have had to take a long sweep
Tethered to earth
N
By a curious perversity of fate
sour, malignant, and envious
His face burnt like a brand
Here I only insist upon
To a practised eye
Her voice trailed off vaguely
Be not deceived
Her interest flagged
I must try to describe to you
I am at your service
I think we may ask in reply
Nerveless and faithless folly
I can not be content with
Reluctant as we are to believe
I like it immensely
Far off and incredibly remote
I shall not enlarge upon
clear, cloudless, and serene
N
Dark and deep as night
I have demonstrated to you
Womanly fickleness and caprice
LITERARY EXPRESSIONS A
Let me persuade you
You are as hard as stone
You remember how
For it is not right to
A perfect crime of clumsiness
Constant as gliding waters
If I could find words
I regard as an erroneous view
I sanction with all my heart
I mean by this
A gloom overcame him
To this it will be replied
The blackest abyss of despair
I might try to explain
It's so kind of you to come
Leapt like a hunted stag
I appeal to the better judgment
A vague aversion
threats, cries, and prayers
I am not prepared to say
It is of very little importance
satirical critic
It is in vain
His first zeal was flagging
G
It may be conjectured
meaningless confusion
yoke of convention
As foam from a ship's swiftness
And to all this must be added
I have always maintained
As dumb as a fish
Or to come nearer home
As easily as the sun shines
L
end, aim, and purpose
plainspoken rebuke
It will be readily appreciated
Let us look nearer home
I fearlessly appeal
It is true, I am grieved to say
I need not enter into
Pallor of reflected glories
Q
This leads us to inquire
I would suggest first of all
Your blood is red like wine
She moved like mirth incarnate
R
oaths and revilings
It is not ours to pronounce
It suggests at the outset
I purposely have avoided
Very strange is this indeed
smirking commonplace
A relish for the sublime
Let us not be misled
I could wish that this belief
leaping ambition
class demarcations
It is amazing how little
utter and disastrous
A voice as low as the sea
It is an incredible thing
B
It may be plausibly objected
U
A waking dream overshadowed her
Do not suppose for a moment
I grant all this
Will you permit me to thank you
Is it not wise to argue
It is merely a mood
Breathed like a sea at rest
I stand corrected
That is most fortunate
I pause for a moment to say
I particularly allude to
I am not of those who pretend
I frankly confess that
Affecting a tone of gayety
It proved a bitter disillusion
In this respect
Few indeed there are
A hideous absurdity
We may be permitted to remember
Violating all decency
The youth of the soul
A torn and tumultuous sky
It will be asked me how
I hesitate to take an instance
Such, then, is the true idea
I am very happy to be here
It may sound strange to you
Far from it
In reply to your valued favor
It is difficult to avoid saying
Nor need we fear to speak
A rare precision of insight
Submission to an implied rebuke
I happen to differ
Then I have your permission?
A man in my situation has
Soft as Spring
An air of affected civility
Assuredly I do
I must thank you once more
set in motion
His gaze searched her face
The stream forgot to smile
I set out with saying
Shall I tell you
Due to historical perspective
I should fail in my duty if
Endowed with life and emphasis
I think when we look back upon
The ebb and flow of events
No one can see the end
I have no fear of myself
A time of disillusion followed
P
And now the chief points of it
M
It may indeed be unavoidable
From one point of view we are
Pale and vague desolation
I earnestly maintain
We must not mistake
After reminding the hearer
I leave it to you
He was measured and urbane
But I cherish the hope
The night was drowned in stars
An apostle of unworldly ardor
versed in knowledge
Fine precision of intent
I feel a great necessity to
I regret this the less
There is a conviction
versatile grace
It is not an unknown occurrence
It has struck me very forcibly
A copious torrent of pleasantry
I speak forth my sentiment
A somewhat melancholy indolence
Put on gravity like a robe
The more's the pity
In the realm of conjecture
I am thoroughly convinced
Do what you will
He clatters like a windmill
I think I am correct in saying
A reckless fashion
outworn creed
How very surprising
I take that for granted
I think I can claim a purpose
Observe again
It enslaves the imagination
I will say at once
It reminds me of an anecdote
Lapse into pathos and absurdity
I can not boast of
A high pitch of eloquence
The vast cathedral of the world
I have lived to see
Dangerously near snobbery
My last criticism upon
Night falls like fire
Full of majestic tenderness
I fear lest I may
His sensibilities were offended
I suffered agonies of shyness
We hope you will appreciate
I doubt very much whether
Y
No true man ever believes
Now, let me stop a moment
In very truth
There she soars like a seraph
What would you say
It is not my purpose to discuss
I was sincerely astonished
If we are rightly informed
Let us scrutinize the facts
Give vent to his indignation
It's really very perplexing
brain, energy, and enterprise
As if smitten by a sudden spasm
Yes and no
It is not wholly insignificant
If we are not blind to
It amounts to this
I begin by observing
ideas and achievements
I am inclined to suspect
The hollowest of hollow shams
We have need to examine
uncritical position
variable temperament
D
The most concise tribute paid
We can not escape the truth
Shall we have a compact?
I am absolutely bewildered
It depends upon circumstances
I have the honor to remain
Here, then, we are involved
A mood of hard skepticism
kindle with enthusiasm
G
I think extremely well of it
Let us not for a moment forget
relapse into savagery
Swift as lightning
Supreme arbiter of conduct
His brow was in his hand
I dare say you know
We have here plain proof
I take leave to say
Certain it is
squandered talent
I will not allude
His hand supported his chin
I do not belong to those who
Unaware of her bitter taunt
In a most impressive vein
And her cheek was like a rose
It is quite an easy matter
Exploded like a penny squib
E
I fancy I hear you say
The nascent spirit of chivalry
I do not contend
L
I come at length to
But what is the fact
Can I persuade you?
I think we may say, therefore
C
This, surely, is the conclusion
Sheer superfluity of happiness
R
lying equivocations
If I were to recapitulate
I am also bound to say
Let me urge you earnestly
I am sure I feel no hostility
In something of a parallel way
I well recollect the time
A profusion of compliments
In an eminent and unique sense
This being the case
Babbling like a child
gay defiance
The silence grew stolid
I mean, moreover
It would be ill-advised
And how am I to thank you?
The brunt of life
I wish at the outset
It is fitting
I close with the words
I have another objection
I shall hope to interest you
honors, riches, and power
guide, philosopher, and friend
I desire to be brief
He bowed submission
It is a sure sign

The pull of soul on body

Rely upon it
Like separated souls
But it is otherwise with
incensed and alarmed
Such, in brief, is the story
Wrapped in an inaccessible mood
The most servile acquiescence
Brisk directness of speech
In order to complete the proof
Fastidious correctness of form
cadaverous appearance
She walked like a galley-slave
It is a fact well known
Like a poet hidden
I have incidentally dwelt on
It sounds very alluring
Again, it is urged
If, then, I am asked
An unerring sense of humor
It was a matter of notoriety
I find no better example than
IMPRESSIVE PHRASES
My present business is
By means of crafty insinuations
I do not disguise the fact
You will bear me out when I say
SECTION VII
Assuredly it is this
Not averse to a little gossip
A patchwork of compromises
How many a time
I profess
Air like wine
This is suggested to us
A convenient makeshift
I can with propriety speak here
I might go on to illustrate
Few subjects are more fruitful
As still as a stone
An air of round-eyed profundity
V
I sympathize deeply with you
P
L
If we sincerely desire
I have no intention to moralize
It is not possible to recount
In the twinkling of an eye
At the risk of digression
I confess, I find it difficult
If we embark upon a career
Before going further
Fostering and preserving order
Motionless as a plumb line
A species of moral usurpation
M
In all ages of the world

They were vastly dissimilar
In the next place, be assured
In a diversity of application
There is nothing to show
I long to speak a word or two

Tinsel glitter of empty titles
H
Appeal to a tardy justice
He was dimly mistrustful of it
A sigh of large contentment
No distinct test can be named
If only we go deep enough
Her bright eyes were triumphant
For let it be observed first
Two things are made very clear
One has no choice to endure it
It is curious to observe
Flame like a flag unfurled
So men are asking
humanitarian impulse
I think I have rightly spoken
Unmoving as a tombstone
You speak with authority
I have long ago insisted
I am under the impression
I am sensible of the flattery
For myself, certainly I think
It will not surely be objected

They are painted sharp as death
I shall now proceed to show
The quick pulse of gain
The proof is in this fact
My own private opinion is
My mind is not moved by
As nimble as water
Q
I leave the arduous task
Such considerations as these
Doubt tortured him
The earth looked despoiled
I am really gregarious
An unpatriotic and ignoble act
akin to truth
N
A bloodless diplomatist
As far as this is true
Little wonder therefore
Let me commend to you
I sympathize most heartily
U
E
Vast and vague aspirations
Lash themselves into fury

A tumult of vehement feeling
I am greatly alarmed
A majority of us believe
prosaic, dull, and unattractive
A ruby like a drop of blood
You're succeeding admirably

Like straws in a gust of wind
J
I come to the other assumption
Let us not limit our view
Pursued to a vicious extent
Urbanely plastic and versatile
Arbitrary assumption of power
It will be idle to imply
It is every man's duty to think
I am not unaware
Decidedly so
It may be added
defiant coldness
Her blank gaze chilled you
I shall await your pleasure
I know too well
It is asserted
I am extremely obliged to you
Like a lily in bloom
I will venture a single remark
It is a recognized principle
rough, rude, gruff, and surly
A most laudable zeal
F
I have before me the statistics
The other day I observed
A sonorous voice bade me enter
It is not quite clear
I will not enumerate at present
That is the prevailing idea
I shall with your sanction
It will thus be seen
I add a few suggestions
I resent that kind of thing

I am obliged to add
This appeal to the common sense
Wrapt in inward contemplation
He grew wanton with success
A truth begirt with fire
It can rightly be said
It is a consoling reflection
It is no part of my business
In further illustration
Let me thank you once more
I find it rather monotonous
I don't justify my presumption
When I am told
And then hastily to conclude
questionable data
Perhaps I am indiscreet
And for myself, as I said
M
A specific answer can be given
Lastly, I do not understand
The precursor of violence
It is worth while to notice
You are very gracious
Like wasted hours of youth
Yet I feel quite free to say
I cheerfully submit myself
I am but saying
Yet I suppose it is worth while
What is this but to say
The stars seemed attentive
I am so glad you think that
It was so incredible
I mention these facts because
A sharp difference of opinion
I am sure you will hear me out
I am not concerned to argue
And lest anyone should marvel
The time, gliding like a dream
Resigned to growing infirmities
As mellow and deep as a psalm
When I hear it said
Fanciful, I should say
But to say the truth
I don't want to exaggerate
A very formidable problem
We all agree as to
As radiant as the rose
I personally know that it is so
Calm strength and constancy
It is self-evident
Taking the facts by themselves
Feverish tide of life
I am not insensible
Her lips like twilight water
But besides these special facts
I may say to you calmly
It ought to animate us
Hence arises a grave mischief
Pure as the azure above them
The silver silence of the night
Jealous and formidable foes
Seem to savor of paradox
All sorts of petty tyrannies
I will add the memorable words
Just the reverse is true
A piteous aspect of woe
I am a great admirer
But I digress
A grim face like a carved mask
I might go on indefinitely
I have assumed throughout
Dispel all anxious concern
In our estimate of the past
Whatever opinion I may express
Like a river of molten amethyst
I have one step farther to go
I made bold to retort
I shall best attain my object
We have found it impossible
You judge yourself too severely
Swift as the panther in triumph
I do not feel at liberty
abashed into silence
I thought it most amusing
G
Vast sweep of mellow distances
E
The crimson close of day
I admit it most gratefully
It is in this characteristic
I can only hope for indulgence
A potential menace to life
How is this to be explained
As you, doubtless, are aware
A wordless farewell
Transparent like a shining sun
It has been my privilege
On the horns of a dilemma
Fulsome praise, I call it
Do not think me guilty of
I think you are quibbling
Some flash of witty irrelevance
There is a common saying
I regret the time limits me
As in the footsteps of a god
But we think it is not wise
Feeding his scholarly curiosity
It's past my comprehension
It sometimes seems to me
Of course I am delighted
It is very common to confuse
Dismal march of death
His mind was like a lonely wild
We may not know precisely how
Like a glow-worm golden
The flight of the autumnal days

Our thoughts wander back

Now, bear with me when I say
An ominous lull and silence
O
I need not wander far in search
You all know the history of
But never was a grosser wrong
The lights blazed up like day
I look with inexpressible dread
Trembling like an aspen-leaf
I may venture upon a review
Like the bellowing of bulls
I have but one more word to add
I suppose it is right to answer
An interchange of civilities
Do you realize that you can
Faintly, like a falling dew
It is a falsehood to say
Can it be supposed
But the fact is
I speak what I know when I say
suffuse with spirituality
It is assumed as an axiom
I even add this
I argue this cause
I have touched very cursorily
It also pleases me very much
It shall be as you wish
Unbends like a loosened bow
It hardly fits the character
Ransack the vocabulary
I can scarcely accept the offer
By a happy turn of thinking
We must realize conscientiously

But I have heard it argued
I feel that it is not true

I ask this of you
If you think for a moment
I have now explained to you
It is not evident
It will not do for a man to say
Oh, you are very bitter

I have an immense faith in him
